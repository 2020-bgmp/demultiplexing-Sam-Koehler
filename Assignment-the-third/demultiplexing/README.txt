  > Incorporates peer-feedback
  > Clear section dedicated to necesary functions
  > Highly readable, commented code.
  > See "unit_tests" folder for unit tests:
    > Small: This unit test was custom-made to test results for various index/quality combinations
    > Large: This unit test containing 50,000 reads was used as a test-run before analyzing actual dataset
  > User Report
    > Raw: Raw summary output provided in file "summary.txt", the output of demultiplexing.py
    > Report: User-friendly summary output provided in file "summary.pdf"
  > argeparse module used to allo for general CLI input

OUTPUT
  > Demultiplexed data may be found at UO Talapas: /projects/bgmp/skoehler/bioinformatics/Bi622/demultiplexing/Part_3/output

1. Incorporate feedback from peer code reviews
  > Peer-reviewed information was used to generate final code.
  
2. Utilize appropriate functions
  > 

3. Sufficiently comment your code/use docstrings
4. Use unit tests on functions/entire algorithm to ensure it works properly
5. Create a useful report for the end user of your code
6. Use argparse to "generalize" your code

7. Percentage of reads from each sample
8. Overall amount of index swapping
9. Any figures/any other relevant data your code output
